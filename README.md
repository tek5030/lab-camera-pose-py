# Lab 5: Pose and camera geometry
Welcome to lab 5!

In this lab we will experiment with poses in different coordinate frames together with the perspective camera model, using real data taken from a helicopter flying around Holmenkollen.

Start by cloning this repository on your machine. 
Then open the lab project in CLion.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:
1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
2. [From geographical coordinates to pixels](lab-guide/2-from-geographical-coordinates-to-pixels.md)

At an appropriate time, [our proposed solution](https://github.com/tek5030/lab_05_solution) will be made available.

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
